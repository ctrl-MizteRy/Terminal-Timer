Write a quick script so that you can set a timer through terminal while working on a project for thing that you need to do 
You will need to install cowsay in your terminal using either = 'pip install cowsay' or 'sudo apt install cowsay' 
Then add a Path directory to your code from '/.bashrc' with nano 
You can add this line at the end of the file: 'alias whatever-you-want-the-alias-to-be-name = "python3 Absolute/Path/To/Your/program.py"' 
Then run "source /.bashrc" to reload it 
From then on, you can just type "whatever-you-want-the-alias-to-be-name --start -sec -min -hour" in your terminal and the timer script will start running
